Features:

Added a GUI that allows one to change the parameters of feedback for the rotational motion.  The parameters are the physical ones, the frequency and the damping ratio.  One sets the values and then clicks on the button at the bottom to update them.  One can see that with a damping ratio of 1 the motion is stable, but when the ratio is less than one, the angle oscillates.

I set the frequency to 16 Hz and the damping ratio to be 1.  I also set the time constant for the force as required.
